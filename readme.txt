This is an implementation of BLAST.

(Kuch likh dio gavish yahan)

For multiple local sequence alignment, the starting positions of the alignments were stored.
Then we created the (kya naam hota hai) matrix and started iterations using the starting positions previosuly calculated. optimal alignment for every starting position is calculated and stored in an array for further use.
